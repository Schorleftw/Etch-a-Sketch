# Etch-a-Sketch

- Simple Etch-a-Sketch. Task of the Odin Project

# What did I learn?
- When using "appendChild" (in this example I needed to add 256 divs into another div) you need to initialize the div you want to append again after adding it once to the container.

- The CSS float property is used for positioning and formatting content e.g. let an image float left to the text in a container. You can display a grid with this aswell (float: left).
- The CSS clear property is used for specifyng what should happen with the element that is next to a floating element.
- If a floated Element is taller than the containing element, it will "overflow" outside of its container. This can be solved using the clearfix hack.

- To create the grid I also tried to use inline-block but the solution is not as clean as it is with float/clear or css grid

- I also tried flexbox to create the grid but came to the conclusion that CSS Grid is way better for this project

- I learned CSS Grid for this project. I mainly used CSS flexbox before.

- I learned the Usecases for Event Delegation: https://davidwalsh.name/event-delegate

- I learned CSS variables
